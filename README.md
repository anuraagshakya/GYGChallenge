# GetYourGuide Programming Challenge - Reviews App

This project was made as a solution to a programming challenge presented by GetYourGuide GmbH. The app is very simple, with most of its functionality included in a single view. Its main features are:
- Displays user defined number of reviews in its main screen and (TODO) allows the user to sort and filter based on some criteria
- Allows the user to post a new review

## Getting Started

- Clone the project to a local machine
- Run `pod install` as the project uses cocoapods to integrate `SwiftyJSON`
NOTE: Alternatvely, switch to the `PodsIncluded` branch if you want to skip installing
- Open `GYGReviews.xcworkspace`
- Use ``GYGReviews` scheme to build for desired device

### Prerequisites
